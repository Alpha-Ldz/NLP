# LAB2

In this project we met your expectations for the lab2, here is our architecture:<br>

├── figures<br>
├── lib<br>
│   ├── dataLoader.py<br>
│   ├── model.py<br>
└── nlp1.ipynb<br>

We have created a lib folder where we put our python code and all the functions we need. The first file loadData allows to manipulate the dataset, the file model allows to create our model of bayes<br>
We have a file nlp1 which is a notebook presenting our project, we invite you to run it<br>
As our execution takes time, we took the liberty to save some plot in the folder figures in order to save execution time
